# Project Name

## Description
I NP Raam made this project repo after the extensive research and development on a project , created by referring to various repositories Orignal concept stolen from [Nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Gather/Invoke-CredentialsPhish.ps1) and enhancing the code to make it smarter and faster. The primary focus of this project is to explore the capabilities of injecting payloads and extracting data from a computer using the Atiny 85 Ducky scripts.

## Introduction
In a world where information security and penetration testing play a crucial role, the Atiny 85 Ducky scripts offer an intriguing approach. Ducky Script is a scripting language used with USB Rubber Ducky, a small USB device that emulates a keyboard. These scripts can be used for various purposes, including automating tasks, exploiting vulnerabilities, or extracting information from target systems.

This project aims to leverage the power of Ducky scripts with the Atiny 85 to make the process of injecting payloads and retrieving data from a computer more efficient and effective.

## What is Ducky Script?
Ducky Script is a simple and powerful scripting language used in combination with the USB Rubber Ducky. The USB Rubber Ducky is recognized by the target system as a keyboard, allowing it to type out scripts quickly and execute them on the host computer. Ducky scripts can be written to automate tasks, perform various actions, or exploit vulnerabilities, all of which can be useful for ethical hacking, security testing, and automation.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the necessary hardware (Atiny 85) and understand the basic principles of Ducky scripts.
3. Explore the project's source code and documentation.
4. Customize and modify the Ducky scripts as needed for your specific use case.

## Usage
Once you have a good understanding of Ducky Script and the project's code, you can use it for a wide range of purposes, such as security assessments, penetration testing, and automation. Be responsible and ethical in your use of this project, and ensure that you have the appropriate permissions and legal authorization for your actions.
